# crypto_vba
An Excel/VBA project to communicate with various cryptocurrency exchanges APIs

# First steps:
- [kraken](www.kraken.com)
- [poloniex](www.poloniex.com) , ToDo
- [btc-e](www.btc-e.com) , ToDo


The API response is pure JSON, for which you can use e.g. https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-JSON to process

As this is my first Git experiment and Excel/VBA and git don't work that well together, my pushes might be clunky...
