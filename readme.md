# crypto_vba
An Excel/VBA project to communicate with various cryptocurrency exchanges APIs

# First steps:
- [kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)
- [poloniex](https://www.poloniex.com/) , first steps
- [btc-e](https://www.btc-e.com/) , first steps

The API response is pure JSON, for which you can use e.g. https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-JSON to process, which might be included here in this project.
As this is my first Git experiment and Excel/VBA and git don't work that well together, my pushes/forks/updates might be clunky...
